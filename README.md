This third semester Medialogy mini-project for the Programming of Complex Software Systems
course is a functional chat system programmed in C++ using the CodeBlocks and Visual
Studio IDEs. For this application, networking, multithreading, and sockets were mandatory
concepts that had been successfully implemented in the code.

Therefore, this chat system consists of a client and a server. The files for both the client and the
server have the .cpp extension. However, in order to set up both the server and the client to
run properly, the user must firstly open the server.sln file and then the client.sln file. By opening
the .sln files in the first place the user will enable the chat system to run as intended.

The program will as such appear running on two separate windows, one for the client and the
other for the server, with users being able to write messages to one another and read the entire
history of their conversation.
